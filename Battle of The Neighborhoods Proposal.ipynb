    "Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario, one of the largest cities in Canada by population with 2,731,571 residents as of 2016. The majority of the Ontario residents live the the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) which makes it Canada's most populous city. With the wide diversity in Canada and in the City of Toronto, there are many restaurants that offer almost every cuisine that exists on the planet.
